<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>First of all, I think it is worth noting that while I went to college, I did not go to school to be a developer. I was pushed towards development by my first employer, for which I was just a content editor.</p>
<p>I learned development through trial, error, and most importantly, YouTube.</p>
<p>It was not until recently that I realized that while there are a billion tutorials on YouTube, I never came across a service that offered a vital skill that I lacked when I started, pair-programming.</p>
<h3>The Name</h3>
<p>I started reaching out to my fellow developers to see if the idea was a turd or not. In those discussions, I found comfort in knowing that most people I talked to seem to really like the idea, and find value in it immediately.</p>
<p>In one particular conversation, we got quite deep into why the service could be valuable. This service was useful to a wide range of developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newly graduated junior developers</li>
<li>Backend developers looking to get into frontend</li>
<li>Frontend developers with expertise in less modern frontend tooling</li>
<li>Beginners just looking to develop at all</li>
</ul>
<p>As we discussed this further, we struggled to find a tagline. Eventually, words slipped from my mouth that sparked an idea in my friend's mind:</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, like <em>bridging the gap</em> for developers to modern stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He quickly agreed with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, like an <em>overpass</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was sold immediately.</p>
<p>I built the site within the week with a little help from Eleventy, TailwindCSS, Svelte, and Netlify. It's hosted on Netlify too!</p>
